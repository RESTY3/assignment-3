            Great work on your portfolio so far. 
            You've accomplished so much already, 
            like setting up your website and learning 
            best practices for writing. In this video, 
            we'll explain how to build a cohesive and 
            consistent presence online. We covered how 
            to apply your personal brand to your portfolio
             in an earlier video. Your personal brand 
             should come across in your portfolio, on 
             social media, in online UX design 
             communities, and on job search websites. 
             You'll also want to keep handy the worksheets
              you completed about your personal brand, 
              so you can reference them in the next few 
              videos. So, what does it mean to build your
               professional presence online? Start with 
               your personal statement, which was part of 
               the branding worksheet you completed. 
               A personal statement is a one- or 
               two-sentence phrase that describes 
               what you do and what you stand for. 
               Think of a personal statement like your 
               own slogan or tagline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </p>
